Sends daily breakdowns of AWS costs to a Slack channel.

This is a fork of the [original](https://github.com/iandees/aws-billing-to-slack), with customised parameters to make it suitable for running against KTech AWS accounts.

The tool is currently configured to run once a week via CircleCI and post its output to Slack.
